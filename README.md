# RoutingWorkshop

In this workshop we'll practice adding routes to our app.

We have three mages:

- home
- contact
- about-me
- watch

## Instructions

- Add routes so that we can:
- Display the home page when we visit `/`
- Display contact when we visit `/contact`
- Display about-me when we visit `about-me`
- Display watch when we visit `/watch/:id`
  - display the number the user has added in the `:id` position of the URL
  - E.g "Watch, 1" if the user visited the URL `/watch/1`
